            <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
            <p>
                I was born in Las Cruces, New Mexico, which is in the southern part of the United States.
                Born and raised there, I was itching to have my opportunity to start my life somewhere new.
                After 18 years I finally made my first move away from home, which landed me in Trinidad, Colorado.
                It was the first time I really was on my own, being in the state above my home one.
                This was the first stop of an incredible journey, as I only spent a year there. Shortly from there, I made the big 25 hour drive
                to the Pacific Northwest. I moved to Seattle, Washington to attend my second school, which somehow led me to the one I am at now.
                Another year passing and I made the move over to Nanaimo, BC, Canada. I am glad to say I have a little home in each of the places I have been to. 
            </p>

            The journey back home for me.

            <h3>Family and Life in New Mexico</h3>
            <p>
                I am also very proud to say I come from a family of 10. My mom and dad have been together since they were 13! The order
                of kids goes as follows.
                <ol>
                    <li>Gabriel</li>
                    <li>Margarita</li>
                    <li>Aaliyah</li>
                    <li>Gabrielle</li>
                    <li>Alexander</li>
                    <li>Carmelo</li>
                    <li>Josiah</li>
                    <li>Andrew</li>       
                </ol>
                It goes to show that is so much easier for my parents to refer to us by our numbers.
                We grew up in one of the hottest places in all of the US, but with 
                eachother, we had so many great memories in the sun. We played basketball, soccer
                ran races around the blocks, and appreciated the time we got to grow 
                up with eachother.
