            <h2>Early Childhood and Basketball</h2>
            <p>
                As young as first grade my love for basketball grew like no other!
                From the first day I touched a basketball, I knew it would 
                help me get somewhere in life. Whether that meant to get me to see new places
                or prolong me in my education.
            </p>

            <h2>High School</h2>
            <p>
                As I got older, I chose the high school I felt would help me achieve what I was looking for.
                At that point, I knew I wanted to play basketball in college, and had so much support around
                me to do so. I was a district champion my sophomore year, all-district that year and my 
                senior year, and an All-Star my last year. I signed at the end of the season to Trinidad State 
                College in Trinidad, Colorado.

            <h2>College Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I started my collegiate career at Trinidad State College. I spent a year there going to school,
                learning the game at the next level, and developing more of a sense of what I wanted 
                out of my experience. From there I moved to Seattle, Washington, where I attended Edmonds College
                for my second year of eligibility. I truly loved the move and change of scenery. From the dry desert heat, 
                to the beautiful green Pacific Northwest. My experience there shaped who I am now as a person, player, and
                student. Those first two years of college basketball taught me a lot about life and who I wanted to be.

            <h2>Today</h2>
            <p>
                After all the stress and uncertainty, I am so proud to say I am where I am now. Little did I know taking all the risks
                I did would lead me here! VIU is now one of the homes I have engraved in my heart, and I am so proud to play
                for the coaches and teammates I play for. The journey is the dream!
